I'm a data scientist who is passionate about using data science to improve the world and solve real-world problems. I love working on data side-projects and my favorite tools are Python and SQL. 

### My life

I studied engineering as an undergraduate and have work experience in the online media industry in New York City. 

As a lifelong learner, I love learning about new technologies and want to use my background and experience for social good.
