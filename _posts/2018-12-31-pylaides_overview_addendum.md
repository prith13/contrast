In the [PyLadies overview](https://prith13.github.io/posts/2018/11/pyladies-overview/), our calculations were based on the categorization of PyLadies global chapters outlined below. 

There are a total of 87 PyLadies chapters worldwide. Many chapters use Meetup.com as a way to organize meetups, hackathons and other such events. However, there are also other ways these chapters communicate, mainly: Facebook Groups, their own websites, and Twitter. In order to properly analyze the data, we used the categorization described below:

PyLadies chapters are initially broken down into four categories by their activeness and communication tool: 

- chapters on Meetup.com
- active non-Meetup chapters
- inactive chapters
- and chapters whose activeness we are unsure about.

Chapters on Meetup are further broken down into active and inactive chapters:
- Active meetup chapters are chapters that have held at least one event in 2018
- Inactive meetup chapters are chapters that have not held an event in 2018

Active non-Meetup chapters are chapters that have some digital presence in 2018 (Facebook group post, Twitter tweet, blogpost), but no Meetup.com chapter or inactive Meetup.com chapter.

Inactive chapters are chapters that have no digital presence in 2018: no Meetup.com event, no blogpost, no tweet, or no Facebook post. This also includes closed chapters.

Any chapter that doesnâ€™t fall into the above categories is categorized as 'unsure'. 

All the data visualizations in the [PyLadies overview](https://prith13.github.io/posts/2018/11/pyladies-overview/) include chapters labeled active and unsure based on the breakdown explained above. 

Here are the numbers for the categories:

| Category                   | # of Chapters |
|----------------------------|---------------|
| Total Chapters             | 87            |
| Existing Meetup Chapters   | 59            |
|      Active Meetup Chapters| 33            |
|    Inactive Meetup Chapters| 26            |
|Active Non-Meetup Chapters  | 22            |
|Inactive Chapters           | 25            |
|Unsure                      | 7             |
